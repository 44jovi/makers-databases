Challenge
This is a process feedback challenge. That means you should record yourself doing it and submit that recording to your coach for feedback. How do I do this?

To work on this challenge, first:

Setup a new project directory book_store following the guidance.
Create a new database book_store.
Import this SQL seed into that new database.
Then, start recording yourself, and:

Copy the Design Recipe Template and adapt it to test-drive and implement the two classes for the books table. Since the table is already created, so you can skip step 1.
Write a small program in app.rb using the class BookRepository to print out the list of books to the terminal. You should get an output that looks roughly like this:
# In the project directory book_store

$ ruby app.rb
